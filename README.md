### ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ Example :

Here's a simple example of what you might do (beginning at the root) :

```
$ goaoc p
// Creates 2023/day17 
$ goaoc g 
// Prints out first part of 2023/day17
// User: solve part 1
$ goaoc r t 
// Output seems to match expected for test input 
$ goaoc r i
// Output seems legit
$ goaoc s
// You solved it!
$ goaoc g -p2
// Prints out second part of 2023/day17
// User: solve part 2
// Same commands as before to run and solve!
// How good is my code ?
$ goaoc b
```

## ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ Setup

If you want to setup the workflow, don't forget to put your **secrets** in the Github Actions **Secrets**.

You will also need to allow Github Actions to push on the repo.


## ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ Customization

You can customize your AoC as you wish !

Here's a list of interesting files to modify:
